## CQRS NestJS API
This is an RESTful API created to implement CRQS in nodejs under [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) Framework 

This API demonstrates a simple CQRS setup using **MongoDB**. It provides the following endpoints for creating and retrieving users:

* POST /users
* GET /users/:id

CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level.

Thanks to CQRS, we can decouple reads and writes logic by emmiting and responding to Commands.

For example, we can dispatch a CreateUserCommand in our controller, and then handle its logic in its own command handler as shown below.

```typescript
@CommandHandler(CreateUserCommand)
export class CreateUserHandler implements ICommandHandler<CreateUserCommand> {
	constructor(private readonly userRepository: UserRepository, private readonly publisher: EventPublisher) {}

	async execute(command: CreateUserCommand) {
		const user = this.publisher.mergeObjectContext(await this.userRepository.create(command.userDto));

		user.sendUserCreatedEvent();
		user.commit();
	}
}
```
